# LIRI
LIRI is the console log version of Siri, LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
If you type in the word "how to do" into the terminal while using "node liri.js . . .", the terminal will tell you the syntax for this app.
alternatively, you can use concert-this 'artist', spotify-this-song 'song' or 'song artist', movie-this 'movie title', do-what-it-says. also if you dont input anything into the "...-this" then it will return a default parm.
